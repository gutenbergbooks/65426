<h1 title=""><i class="ss smallest">INDUSTRIAL MINERALS AND METALS OF ILLINOIS</i></h1>
<p class="jr1"><span class="ss">J. E. Lamar</span></p>
<p class="tb">The mineral resources of Illinois include many rocks and
minerals of varied character and uses. From them are
made an array of everyday products whose sources may
not even be recognized by the consumer. The user of a
glass bottle, for instance, rarely knows that it may have been
made from Illinois silica sand, nor is the driver of an automobile
generally aware that the Illinois concrete highway on which he is
driving probably was constructed from a mixture of cement, sand
and gravel, or crushed stone that may have come from Illinois
pits or quarries.</p>
<p>The significance of these rocks and minerals to the economy
of Illinois is great, although often unappreciated. Of the more
than 600 million dollar value of all Illinois mineral production in
1963, almost 200 million was from industrial minerals. The diversity
and widespread distribution of these mineral resources lend
variety and balance to the mineral industry of the state, and their
production, processing, and utilization afford direct and indirect
employment to many people.</p>
<p>The term industrial minerals is used as a convenient
group term for nonmetallic minerals that are not fuels. In Illinois
they include limestone, dolomite, clay, shale, silica sand and
other sands, fluorspar, tripoli (amorphous silica), ganister, novaculite,
sandstone, feldspar-bearing sands, barite, gypsum, anhydrite,
brines, greensand, oil shale, marl, peat, humus, and
tufa. The metallic minerals of Illinois are galena (lead ore),
sphalerite (zinc ore), pyrite, and marcasite.</p>
<p>This booklet briefly and nontechnically discusses the
foregoing materials and some of the work the Illinois State Geological Survey
does in gathering information about their occurrence,
and character and in developing new uses.</p>
<p>The assistance of many Survey staff members and of many
people in the Illinois mineral industry in the preparation of this
booklet is acknowledged.</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">LIMESTONE</span></h2>
<p>Limestone is a most versatile rock. Without it there would
be no portland cement for making concrete roads and buildings, no
lime for plastering and chemical use, no agricultural limestone for
farms, and no crushed limestone for driveways. A wide
variety of industries, from steel making to glass manufacturing,
use limestone in one way or another.</p>
<p>The early settlers of Illinois recognized the value of limestone
and quarried stone blocks and slabs for making foundations,
chimneys, and even houses. For mortar they used a mixture of sand
and lime to hold the blocks together. The lime was made by heating
limestone red hot in simple furnaces or kilns, the ruins of a few of
which may still be seen.</p>
<h3 id="c2">Kinds of Limestone</h3>
<p>Illinois has two principal varieties of limestone, referred
to technically as limestone and dolomite. &ldquo;Limestone&rdquo; may be
used as a general name for both varieties.</p>
<p>Limestone consists principally of crystalline particles of
the mineral calcite (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). This mineral is glassy in appearance
and is composed of calcium, carbon, and oxygen combined to form
calcium carbonate&mdash;CaCO&#8323;. Dolomite is largely made of crystalline
particles of the mineral dolomite, which also has a glassy
appearance and consists of calcium, magnesium, carbon, and oxygen&mdash;CaMg(CO&#8323;)&#8322;.
The crystalline particles of limestone and dolomite
vary in size. Some are coarse enough to be seen easily, others
are so small that they can be distinguished only with a microscope.</p>
<h3 id="c3">Formation of Limestone and Dolomite</h3>
<p>Almost all Illinois limestones were formed in seas that
covered Illinois millions of years ago. The many different limestone
formations in Illinois suggest that oceans covered all or
part of the area several times. Numerous kinds of shell fish, corals,
and other marine animals lived in these oceans and had shells and
other hard parts made of calcium carbonate. Through countless
generations, these animal remains accumulated on the ocean floor
and gradually were compacted and cemented into limestone (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>).</p>
<p>Other Illinois limestones, however, were formed by the
hardening of muds composed mainly of calcium carbonate that
accumulated on the floors of the ancient seas. Still other limestones
were formed of a combination of animal remains and lime
mud.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 1&mdash;Calcite crystals. Limestone is made up mainly of calcite
crystals, but they are less perfectly formed and are crowded together.</p>
</div>
<p>The coral reefs of the South Pacific Ocean have their
counterparts in Illinois. The ancient Illinois oceans contained
extensive reefs that were built up just as the modern reefs have been.
In northern Illinois, around Chicago for instance, a number of the
ancient reefs are now the site of stone quarries. In southwestern
Illinois such reefs are a source of petroleum.</p>
<p>The dolomites of Illinois probably were originally limestones,
but, either while the limestones were still beneath the
sea or after the sea had withdrawn, magnesium was exchanged
for some of the calcium in the limestones. If the exchange took
place under the sea, the sea water was the source of the magnesium.
If it happened when the limestones were a part of the land, the
magnesium was brought in by water circulating through the rock.
Many of the marine animal fossils became difficult to recognize
after the change, and the texture and general appearance of the
rock also were altered. Some of it became noticeably porous.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c4">Uses of Limestone and Dolomite</h3>
<p>Some of the major uses for Illinois limestone and dolomite
are mentioned below. Not every limestone or dolomite can be used
for all purposes because for each use the stone must fulfill special
requirements of a chemical or physical nature. For example,
it must have high purity for lime, resistance to wear and weather
for roads and buildings, and a pleasing appearance for decorative
stone and marble.</p>
<p><i>Lime.</i>&mdash;When limestone or dolomite is heated to a high
temperature, it undergoes a change and carbon dioxide is liberated.
The weight of the gas set free is equal to somewhat less than half
the weight of the rock if the rock is pure. The solid product remaining
after the gas has been driven off is known as lime. The
heating process is called burning.</p>
<p>Besides being used in making mortar and plaster, lime is
valuable in many other ways, especially in various chemical
processes of modern industry. Plants at Chicago and Quincy
make lime from Illinois limestone and dolomite.</p>

<div class="img" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="614" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 3&mdash;An Illinois dolomite quarry.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Cement.</i>&mdash;Portland cement, sometimes called simply cement,
is made at LaSalle, Oglesby, and Dixon in northern Illinois
from limestone and a smaller, carefully measured amount of clay
or shale. Cement also is made at Joppa in southern Illinois. The
blend of materials is thoroughly ground and mixed, then heated
at a high temperature in huge rotating horizontal furnaces, called
kilns, until it forms a clinker. After it cools, the clinker is ground
to a flourlike powder. This is basically the cement that binds together
the mixture of sand and limestone (or dolomite), or of sand
and gravel, to make the concrete from which roads, bridges, buildings,
and other structures are made.</p>
<p><i>Aggregate.</i>&mdash;The crushed stone used in making concrete
is known as concrete aggregate. This is a major use for Illinois
limestones and dolomites. Large amounts of stone aggregate also
are used in bituminous roads, popularly called &ldquo;blacktop&rdquo; roads.</p>
<p><i>Agricultural Uses.</i>&mdash;Agricultural limestone (agstone) is applied
to farm land to neutralize soil acids and otherwise benefit
the soil. Both limestone and dolomite are so used. Chickens are
fed small limestone chips to provide calcium for the formation of
egg shells. Pigs and cows get calcium from mineral supplements
containing powdered pure limestone.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 4&mdash;An underground limestone mine.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Other Uses.</i>&mdash;Illinois limestone or dolomite is used in steel
making, as building stone and marble, as road stone, as ballast
for the road beds of railroad tracks, for making refractory dolomite
used in the steel industry, and for a variety of less common uses.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Quarries</h3>
<p>There are about 200 stone quarries in Illinois. Most of
the larger quarries (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) are in the Chicago, Joliet, Kankakee,
and East St. Louis areas, but one or more limestone or dolomite
quarry occurs in many counties.</p>
<p>If all the stone taken from Illinois quarries in 1963 were
removed from a hole 100 feet square, the hole would penetrate into
the earth about 8 miles. It would take more than 350,000 railroad
cars holding 100 tons each to haul away the stone. Limestone,
dolomite, and their products added over 80 million dollars to the
economy of the state in 1963, approximately 8 dollars for each person
in Illinois.</p>
<p>Most Illinois limestone and dolomite is quarried from open
pits, but in some places, as in the rocky bluffs along the Mississippi
River, the stone is taken from underground mines (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
There is also a dolomite mine in Chicago. At the quarries the first
step is the removal of the earth overlying the stone. Next, in both
pit and mine, the stone is blasted to free it from the parent deposit
and break it into pieces. Mechanical shovels (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) load the
stone into trucks that take it to the crushing plant where powerful
crushers further break the stone into pieces. The pieces are sorted
into various sizes by large screens. At some of the plants, the
stone is ground into powder.</p>
<h3 id="c6">Location of Limestone Deposits</h3>
<p>The geologic map of Illinois prepared by the Illinois State
Geological survey shows, with reasonable exactness, what bedrock
formations would crop out at the surface if the overlying clay,
sand, gravel, and earth were removed. Thick dolomite formations
would be exposed in much of the northern fifth of the state, but
would be rare elsewhere. Thick limestone formations would occur
in an almost continuous zone, varying in width from 3 to 25 miles,
along the Mississippi River from Rock Island to southern Illinois
and then eastward across the extreme southern tip of the state.
Limestone also would be seen along the Illinois River from Havana
southward.</p>
<p>In the central area of the state, limestones are present,
but they are rarely over 25 and often less than 15 feet thick. Consequently,
most of the larger quarries are in the northern, western,
and southern parts of Illinois. The thinner limestones, nonetheless,
are of much importance and are quarried at many places,
chiefly to provide agricultural limestone, road stone, and limestone
for making cement.</p>
<p>The Geological Survey locates and maps limestone and
dolomite deposits and analyzes and tests samples to determine
the best possible uses for the stone. Many reports have been published
about the character and general use of the deposits in various
parts of the state. Other reports deal with the use of limestone
and dolomite for specific purposes such as cement making, building
and decorative stone, rock wool, terrazzo chips, and lime.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">METALLIC ORES AND FLUORSPAR</span></h2>
<h3 id="c8">Lead and Zinc</h3>
<p>Lead mining was one of the earliest industries of Illinois.
The early settlers&rsquo; need for bullets for procuring food and for defense
of their lives and property made lead an important commodity, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the deposits of lead ore in the northwestern corner of Illinois were
quickly exploited. The ore was the mineral galena (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>), for
which the city of Galena in Jo Daviess County is believed to have
been named.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1062" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 5&mdash;Galena with cubic cleavage blocks in foreground.</p>
</div>
<p>Galena is a dark, shiny mineral that breaks readily into
cubes or combinations of cubes. It is composed of lead and sulfur
(PbS). Galena itself is not suitable for use as a metal; the lead
must first be separated from the sulfur.</p>
<p>The earliest method of recovering lead from galena was
crude. A pile of logs, smaller pieces of wood, and ore was built
on sloping ground. Just below it a pit was dug. When the wood
was set on fire, the heat caused the lead and sulfur to separate,
and the molten lead trickled down into the pit. The smelting process
was later improved, and stone &ldquo;furnaces&rdquo; were built to house the
operations.</p>
<p><i>Crevice Deposits and Residual Deposits.</i>&mdash;Most of the lead
ore mined in the early days of the northwestern Illinois mining
district came from crevice deposits in the dolomite bedrock and
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
from residual deposits at or near the surface of the ground. The
crevices were vertical narrow joints or fissures. Ore was not
continuously present along them but occurred from place to place
in &ldquo;pods&rdquo; (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a> and <a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>). Dimensions of the pods varied, but
typical ones were about 3 feet wide, 5 feet high, and a few to a
few hundred feet long. The galena, for the most part, occurred in
a mixture of clay and weathered dolomite that filled, or partly
filled, the crevices.</p>
<p>The residual deposits were found where the action of the
weather for many thousands of years had dissolved the dolomite
from the outcropping parts of a crevice deposit and left behind a
residue of brown or red clay containing galena.</p>
<p>Some of the crevice and residual deposits worked by the
early miners cropped out at the surface, but most of them were
covered by earth. Other crevices were exposed in the bluffs of
the Mississippi River and extended back into them for 1,000 feet
or more.</p>

wide and 5 feet high.</p>

<p>When the richer deposits of ore in the crevices were
worked out, some mines were deepened into the dolomite bedrock,
but usually less rather than more galena was found.</p>
<p>As the amount of galena decreased, however, another mineral,
which had been present before in only small amounts, was
found in increasing quantities. This was sphalerite&mdash;a yellow,
brown, or black mineral of resinous appearance that is composed
of zinc and sulfur (ZnS). It does not look like a metallic ore.</p>
<p>At first the sphalerite was not used because there were no
smelters in the area that could separate the zinc from the sulfur
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
with which it was combined in the ore. Between 1850 and 1870,
however, smelters were built in northwestern Illinois and southern
Wisconsin and the ore was shipped there. Sphalerite is now the
principal ore mineral produced in northwestern Illinois.</p>
<p>The sphalerite and galena of southern Illinois, described
later, are similar to that found in northwestern Illinois.</p>

his head and another at level of his waist.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p><i>Mining and Milling.</i>&mdash;One large mine is producing zinc
and lead near Galena at present. Smaller mines operate irregularly.
The ore may occur as pockets, irregularly shaped rather flat masses,
vertical or inclined veins (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>), or small particles scattered
through the dolomite. The principal ore bodies that have been worked
in recent years have been of irregular shape, both horizontally
and vertically, and usually have been between 50 and 200 feet wide
and from a few to as much as 100 feet high. They lie at a depth
of roughly 300 feet.</p>
<p>Blasting is required to loosen and break the ore. At the
large mine the ore is brought to the surface by a hoist. In some
relatively shallow mines an inclined tunnel has been driven to the
ore body and the ore brought to the surface in trucks.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 8&mdash;Diagrammatic cross section
of a zinc ore deposit showing flats
and pitches. The deposit occurs in
limestone and dolomite. Much of
the ore is a mixture of dolomite,
limestone, calcite, and sphalerite.
Typical dimensions of such a deposit
are about 30 feet high and 100 to 200
feet wide.</p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>ORE</dt>
<dt>PITCHES</dt>
<dt>FLATS</dt></dl>
<p>Because the ore consists of galena and sphalerite attached
to and scattered through dolomite, it must be milled to free and
separate the metals from the rock. Crushing, grinding, and other
operations are involved. The dolomite is discarded and the galena
and sphalerite concentrates are shipped away to be smelted. No
smelters have operated in the Galena area for some time.</p>
<p><i>Aids to Prospecting.</i>&mdash;Finding deposits of ore 300 feet underground
is not easy. Inspection of the surface usually tells little.
To find and outline a commercial ore deposit many holes often must
be drilled to explore the unexposed rock strata. Because this is a
costly process, every possible means is employed to drill the holes
where ore is most likely to be found. This is where geologists
are useful&mdash;geologists of the mining companies and of the Illinois
Geological Survey. Three examples of how their investigations
help to find ore are given here.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>It was noted early in the development of the northwestern
Illinois mining district that zinc ore deposits were most common
along small downfolds in the bedrock, called synclines, that were
a few hundred feet wide and a mile or so long. The synclines were
associated with much larger synclines that extended for several
miles. A map prepared by the Illinois Geological Survey shows
the possible location and extent of many of these downfolds and
has had much practical use in the selection of the most promising
areas for test drilling to find ore.</p>
<p>The Survey also collects the records of borings made by
companies and individuals in their search for ore. The records
are on permanent file at the Survey offices and are valuable in
several ways. Some indicate where no ore was found and where
it is, therefore, useless to drill further; others show only traces
of ore but suggest that more drilling in the vicinity might discover
a deposit large enough to be mined profitably. Still other records
are of borings that encountered rich ore in which mines have been
developed.</p>
<p>The third aid to prospecting is the study of ore bodies and
their minerals to determine how the deposits were formed. The ore
bodies have been and are being studied in the mines. Ore specimens
are carefully examined in the Survey laboratories. If geologists
can learn how the known deposits were formed, it may be
possible to direct exploration into promising new areas.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Fluorspar</h3>
<p>In the southeastern tip of Illinois lie deposits of a mineral
that contains the chemical element fluorine. This element is used
in making the propellant that activates aerosol sprays, a plastic
that resists chemicals and oil and is strong enough to be used for
bearings, compounds that are said to help to prevent tooth decay,
and many other useful chemicals.</p>
<p>The mineral is fluorite (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9</a>), commonly called fluorspar.
It is composed of calcium fluoride (CaF&#8322;), a compound of calcium
and fluorine, and is a glassy mineral that is generally white or
gray but may be purple, rose, yellow, blue, or green. In rare
instances it is colorless.</p>
<p>Fluorspar mining in Hardin and Pope Counties began with
lead mining. Galena was first discovered there in 1839 in a well
being dug at the town of Rosiclare. Mining of galena began in the
early 1840&rsquo;s, and somewhat later ore was being smelted by three
furnaces, all of which have long since disappeared.</p>
<p>The veins that were worked for galena also contained fluorspar,
but as there was little or no use for fluorspar in the 1840&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
it was considered waste. In time, uses developed, however, and
about 1870 it was mined and shipped in commercial quantities.
Since then the tonnage and value of the fluorspar produced from the
Rosiclare area have increased until fluorspar is the major product.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="841" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 9&mdash;Group of cubic fluorite crystals.</p>
</div>
<p>The fluorspar mining district north of the town of Cave in
Rock in eastern Hardin County also was an early producer of galena.
In that area the fluorspar-galena deposits are elongate and approximately
flat. The first miners followed the ore bodies from outcrops
by tunneling into the hillsides. In the late 1930&rsquo;s and early
1940&rsquo;s, many holes were drilled into the bedrock in search of new
deposits. Ore was found that contained not only galena and fluorspar
but also important amounts of sphalerite.</p>
<p><i>Vein Deposits.</i>&mdash;In the Rosiclare district, the fluorspar
and its accompanying minerals occur as steeply inclined veins a
few inches to 25 feet or more wide (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>), usually in limestone
strata. The veins are not uniformly thick but widen or narrow
from place to place both vertically and horizontally. They occur
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
along faults&mdash;planes along which the rocks of the earth&rsquo;s crust
have broken and slipped. A fault may be a single plane of slippage
but more often is a zone of broken and displaced rocks. In
most of the faults that contain fluorspar, the slippage is vertical,
or nearly so. Along one of the faults in the Rosiclare district,
the rocks on one side of the fault have moved downward as much
as 650 feet in relation to the rocks on the other side. Some faults
are more than 10 miles long, and the depth to which they extend
into the earth is unknown. Fluorspar has been mined from one of
them at depths of 800 feet. Not all faults, nor all parts of any
one fault, contain fluorspar.</p>

<p><i>Bedding Deposits.</i>&mdash;In contrast to the vein deposits of the
Rosiclare district, the bedding deposits of the Cave in Rock area
are flat, or nearly flat, commonly 5 to 15 feet thick, and from a
few to 200 feet wide (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>). They may be as much as 2000 feet
long, widening or narrowing and thickening or thinning throughout
their extent. They are called bedding deposits because they lie
along the beds or layers of the limestone in which they occur.
Most of the ore bodies are associated with a fracture or a small
fault.</p>

<p><i>Grades and Uses of Fluorspar.</i>&mdash;There are three principal
grades of fluorspar&mdash;metallurgical, acid, and ceramic. The metallurgical
spar is used as a flux in making steel and in metal foundries.
Acid spar is used to make hydrofluoric acid, which plays a
part in the preparation of uranium isotopes and in the production
of a synthetic mineral essential in refining aluminum. The acid
is also used in the production of high-octane gasoline and is the
basis for a variety of important chemical compounds, among them
refrigerants and insecticides. Ceramic grade fluorspar is used in
making enamels, glazes, and certain kinds of glass.</p>
<p><i>Mining and Milling.</i>&mdash;Fluorspar and its associated ores
are mined in different ways in the Rosiclare and Cave in Rock
districts because the types of deposits differ. However, in both
areas most of the larger mines are entered by vertical shafts.
In the mines, explosives are placed in holes drilled by machines
and are then detonated to shoot down the ore (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). Mine cars,
trucks, or conveyor belts carry the ore to the bottom of the mine
shaft where hoists raise it to the mills at the surface. In the mills
a variety of ore-classifying machines separate the galena,
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
sphalerite, and fluorspar from the waste mineral materials (chiefly
limestone and calcite) with which they occur. Some fluorspar after
the separation process is almost flour-fine. To increase its use,
much of this spar is mixed with a binder and made into pellets or
briquets one-half to one inch in size.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="pcap">Figure 12&mdash;Machine loading fluorspar ore in mine near Cave in Rock.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Geological and Chemical Studies.</i>&mdash;Because much of the
fluorspar produced in southern Illinois has come from veins along
faults, geologists have mapped the faults of the area by investigating
the distribution and nature of the various bedrock outcrops.
The work was complicated by the mantle of earth and vegetation
that covers the bedrock at many places. However, a geologic map
was made that shows where the various rock formations&mdash;sandstone,
limestone, and shale&mdash;lie beneath the surface and where the numerous
faults crisscross the district.</p>
<p>The first geologic map of the fluorspar district was made
in 1920 by the Illinois and U. S. Geological Surveys. New maps
on a much larger scale have been made recently by the Illinois
Survey to meet the needs of the modern fluorspar industry.</p>
<p>The Illinois Survey also has studied the ores and ore deposits
of southern Illinois to determine how they were formed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
The records of many borings and pits sunk to find ore have been
collected and filed at the Survey to guide future prospecting.</p>
<p>Survey chemists are finding new uses for Illinois fluorspar.
Their research has produced new organic fluorine compounds
that are being tested for use in agriculture, medicine, and
industry. They also have worked out easier and cheaper methods
of making certain fluorine compounds. Survey chemical engineers
have helped to obtain needed information about the physical properties
of the pellets made from fluorspar powder.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Origin of Illinois Ore Deposits</h3>
<p>The ore deposits of northwestern and southern Illinois
were formed so many millions of years ago that it is possible to
propose only theories of their origin. Most geologists think that
the minerals, dissolved in warm or hot water, came from deep in
the earth. Perhaps the mineral-bearing water came from, or was
associated with, rocks that were or had been molten (igneous
rocks), but it may have had some other source. Why the ores occur
where we now find them is not fully known. The cooling of
the solutions and the lessening of pressure as the solutions rose
toward the surface may have had a part in ore deposition. Faults
and the nature of the rocks encountered by the depositing solutions
also appear to have had an influence.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Illinois as a Mining State</h3>
<p>Although Illinois is not usually thought of as a mining
state, northwestern and southern Illinois together produced in 1963
nearly $5,000,000 worth of zinc, about $600,000 worth of lead,
and $6,500,000 worth of fluorspar. The annual total value is
about $12,000,000.</p>
<p>The southern Illinois fluorspar district has another distinction&mdash;for
many years its mines have been the major domestic
source of the nation&rsquo;s fluorspar.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">SILICA SAND</span></h2>
<p>About 450,000,000 years ago, a shallow ocean covered
Illinois. Its waves and currents carried clean white sand and deposited
it as curving beaches, sand bars, and dunes. This sand
differed from many sands in that it was composed almost exclusively
of grains of the mineral quartz instead of being a mixture
of quartz and other minerals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Quartz is composed of silica (SiO&#8322;), and sands such as
the ancient Illinois sand that are composed of quartz are known as
silica sands. Quartz is very hard and will scratch glass and some
steel. Perfect quartz crystals, which are rare, are longer than
they are thick and end in pyramids. Probably not many grains of
the ancient sand came from perfect crystals; they more likely resulted
from the decaying and breaking down of rocks such as granite,
which are mixtures of quartz grains and other mineral particles.</p>
<p>The quartz grains probably did not come directly from
their source to Illinois. Instead, it is likely they first were deposited
elsewhere and formed into sandstone. That sandstone was
subsequently broken down by weathering agents and the grains
transported to the ancient Illinois sea by streams.</p>
<p>As a result of the erosive action of the agents that transported
them, many of the originally angular grains, particularly
the coarser ones, were rounded and their surfaces dulled like
that of frosted glass (<a href="#fig13">fig. 13</a>). Consequently, they appear white,
although they actually are colorless.</p>
<p>Since the ancient sea deposited its silica sand, other
seas have covered Illinois at various times and each has left
deposits of sand, mud, or limy materials. The silica sand thus
was buried by hundreds of feet of other sediments and became sandstone.
This sandstone is called the St. Peter Sandstone. It is
named from the St. Peter River, now the Minnesota River, in
Minnesota where the sandstone was first described and named by
geologists. The overlying deposits also were consolidated into
rock.</p>
<p>St. Peter Sandstone is exposed at the surface at many
places in northern Illinois and in one small area in the western
part of the state. The sandstone exposed in northern Illinois
generally varies from 125 to 300 feet thick. The fact that it crops
out at the surface indicates that the materials that formerly covered
it have been removed.</p>
<p>The uncovering was not a single, simple event but rather
a series of events that took place at various times during the many
years since the St. Peter sand was deposited. Among these was
the up-bowing of the rocks of central northern Illinois into a broad
arch. Streams then began to cut across the arched rock, slowly
but persistently stripping away the top layers until the core of the
arch was laid bare. Among the rocks thus exposed was the St. Peter
Sandstone, which may be seen in northern Illinois in the valleys
and tributaries of the Rock River near Dixon and Oregon and along
the Illinois and Fox Rivers and some of their tributaries near
Ottawa, Wedron, Millington, and Troy Grove. The St. Peter
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Sandstone at Starved Rock and Matthiessen state parks near LaSalle
and along the highway between Dixon and Oregon is eroded into
scenic bluffs and canyons.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c13">Silica Sand Industry</h3>
<p>The Illinois silica sand industry is based on the St. Peter
Sandstone. It centers around Ottawa, Wedron, Troy Grove, and
Utica in LaSalle County and in Oregon in Ogle County. Two principal
grades of silica sand are produced&mdash;washed and crude. The
value of the silica sand produced in Illinois in 1963 was about
$9,000,000.</p>
<p><i>Washed Sand.</i>&mdash;Although the St. Peter Sandstone is composed
almost entirely of quartz grains, a small amount of clay is
present. For some uses it is not necessary to remove the clay,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
for others its elimination is important and is achieved by washing
the sand.</p>
<p>In the mining of silica sand that is to be washed, the sandstone
is first blasted loose from the parent deposit to break it into
sand or pieces of various sizes. Some of the larger pieces may
require a second blasting to disintegrate them.</p>
<p>At some pits the material is loaded mechanically and transported
to the washing plant. At others a powerful stream of water
is directed against the broken sandstone (<a href="#fig14">fig. 14</a>) and the resulting
mixture of sand and water flows to a collecting basin from
which it is pumped through large pipes to the processing mill.</p>
<p>In both types of operation the sand is thoroughly washed at
the plants. After it is washed, the sand is further processed to
suit the needs of its users. Much of it is screened into different
size grades.</p>
<p><i>Uses of Washed Silica Sand.</i>&mdash;The washed silica sand produced
in Illinois has many uses, some of which are briefly mentioned
below. The suitability of the sand for some purposes depends
in part on its having been screened to specified sizes.</p>
<p>The high purity of Illinois washed silica sand makes it
suitable for making glass, which is more than half silica sand.
Each year over a million tons is used for this purpose. The
purity of the sand also is of importance for chemical and metallurgical
uses such as the manufacture of sodium silicate and silicon
carbide and in alloying.</p>
<p>The hardness of the sand makes it useful for grinding large
sheets of plate glass to prepare them for polishing and also makes
it an effective abrasive agent for sandblasting. Metal castings in
foundries and the exteriors of buildings are cleaned by this process.
Illinois produces thousands of tons of sand yearly for such abrasive
purposes.</p>
<p>Because the coarser grains of the washed silica sand are
rounded, strong, and available in uniform sizes, oil operators use
thousands of tons of it annually in the hydraulic fracturing of oil-bearing
strata. The sand is mixed with oil, other petroleum products,
or water and is forced by powerful pumps into sandstone or
limestone formations that contain oil. The great force thus exerted
opens fractures in the rock strata and pushes the liquid and sand
into them. When the pressure is relieved, the sand grains serve
as props to hold the fractures open. The oil can then flow more
easily into the wells and oil production is thus increased.</p>
<p>The washed sand, because it is clean and does not dissolve
in water, is used to filter impurities from drinking water.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
Its whiteness makes it a desirable constituent in plaster, mortar,
and precast building panels.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1209" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 14&mdash;Hydraulic mining of silica sand near Ottawa.</p>
</div>
<p>Because it is round grained and withstands high temperatures
without melting, large tonnages of the washed silica sand
are used to make molds into which molten metal is poured to make
various kinds of castings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>A special type of coarse silica sand from Illinois that is
carefully prepared so that it is always of the same grain size is
used throughout the world as a standard in laboratories that test
cement and other commercial products.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/p12.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1108" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 15&mdash;Loading crude silica sand.</p>
</div>
<p>Some silica sand is ground to a fine, white powder. The
powder, called ground quartz, ground silica, silica flour, or potter&rsquo;s
flint, has many uses. It is an ingredient in paints, potters
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
use it in making pottery and china, it goes into scouring powders,
into molds used for precision types of metal castings, and into
enamels.</p>
<p><i>Crude Silica Sand.</i>&mdash;The crude silica sand produced from
the St. Peter Sandstone generally is yellow or yellowish white
and is not washed before it is used. It probably originally was
white, but iron oxide, similar to the rust that forms on iron, now
coats many of the sand grains and colors the small amount of
clay in the sand. Thousands of tons of crude silica sand are
mined annually (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>). Because it is highly heat resistant,
foundries buy much of it to make the molds used for castings,
especially steel castings, and for automobile engine blocks,
train wheels, and a variety of other metal products. Crude silica
sand also is used around industrial furnaces to seal cracks and
openings to prevent the loss of heat, in certain ceramic products,
and for adjusting the silica content of the raw materials used for
making portland cement.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Studies of the St. Peter Sandstone</h3>
<p>The Illinois Geological Survey has made field studies and
prepared maps showing where the St. Peter Sandstone is exposed
in northern and western Illinois. Many samples have been screened
and examined under a microscope to determine how the sand of
different deposits, or different parts of the same deposit, varies
in grain size and mineral composition. The possibility of using
Illinois silica sand for making silica brick also has been investigated.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">GRAVEL AND SAND</span></h2>
<p>Some 225,000 years ago, most of what is now Illinois was
buried under the ice of the Illinoian glacier. Two earlier glaciers
had covered large parts of Illinois, and another, known as the
Wisconsinan glacier, came into the state later, about 50,000 to
70,000 years ago (<a href="#fig16">fig. 16</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>The relatively small glaciers in the United States today,
such as those in the northern Rocky Mountains, are concentrated
in valleys and are called valley glaciers. The glaciers that covered
Illinois were parts of huge ice sheets that extended over much
of the North American continent and are called continental glaciers.
They spread over most of Canada, then pushed southward to bury
New England and a great area in the north-central part of the
United States north of the Ohio and Missouri Rivers.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Formation of Gravel and Sand Deposits</h3>
<p>As the glacial ice edged slowly southward from Canada,
it froze fast to and picked up soil and loose pieces of rock, with
enormous force tore away huge chunks of bedrock, and mixed and
ground these materials together (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>).</p>
<p>Into Illinois the
glacier carried rock materials
from Canada, Wisconsin,
Minnesota, and
Michigan; other rock
fragments were picked up
in Illinois as the ice front
advanced. When the glacier
melted, it left behind
its load of rock flour and
rock fragments, much of
it as a gray clay containing
pebbles, cobbles, and
boulders. Geologists call
such deposits glacial till.</p>

<p>The ice in the continental
glaciers usually
crept forward, sometimes
slowly, sometimes more
rapidly. Whether the front
of a glacier moved forward
or back depended on the
balance between the rate
of forward motion of the
ice and the rate of melting.
When the ice advanced
faster than it
melted, the front of the
glacier moved forward.
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
When the glacial ice melted faster than it moved forward, the front
of the glacier receded. When the rates of melting and advance
were about equal, the front of the glacier stood still or moved back
and forth in a narrow zone.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/p13a.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="730" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 17&mdash;Striated boulder. Scratches and flattened surfaces
were caused by abrasion by other rocks while boulder was embedded
in glacial ice.</p>
</div>
<p>When such a more or less stationary front existed, an
enormous amount of clay, silt, sand, pebbles, and boulders was
deposited in a belt only a few miles wide along the front of the
glacier, creating a line of hills and ridges that extended for many
miles. Such belts, called end moraines, can be seen today in
many parts of Illinois.</p>
<p>The building of end moraines often was accompanied by
the release of great quantities of water (meltwater) from the melting
ice. The water, laden with rock debris, flowed from the front of
the glacier in many streams.</p>
<p>As the meltwater flowed away from the glacier it sorted its
load, although the sorting was rarely perfect. The heavy boulders
and pebbles usually were dropped first, then the sand, next the
silt, and finally the clay. In general, the farther the deposits
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
were from the glacier the finer they were. The major streams frequently
carried pebbles 50 to 100 miles from the glacier and it was
many more miles before all the sand was dropped. They carried
some of the fine silt and clay as far as the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Sometimes the floods of glacial water were greater and
flowed faster than usual and so were able to carry coarse rock
materials farther. As a result, gravel was laid down on top of
earlier sand deposits. Later there may have been further sand
deposition.</p>
<p>The debris-laden meltwater that flowed into valleys often
deposited in them a considerable filling of sand and gravel. Some
valleys were filled to a depth of as much as 100 feet. Such deposits
are called valley fills or valley trains. Modern streams
have cut their courses into many of these fills and even worn away
large parts of them. Remnants of valley train deposits are now large
terraces or benches along streams, many of them well above the
present stream channels.</p>
<p>Where many small streams flowed from the glacier, they
deposited sand and gravel as a large apron in front of the glacier.
Such deposits are called outwash plains and many of them extend
for miles.</p>
<p>Two other types of sand and gravel deposits made by glacial
meltwaters also are significant. One was formed where water
issued from the front of a glacier or poured into holes or crevasses
in the ice. The sand and gravel in the water formed a
deposit that now appears as a rounded hill associated with a terminal
moraine and is called a kame. The second type of deposit
was laid down in beds of streams flowing under, through, or on the
glaciers and was left as a more or less continuous ridge of sand and
gravel when the ice melted. Such a deposit is called an esker.
Some eskers in Illinois are about a quarter of a mile wide and
several miles long. Typical are the Kaneville Esker northwest of
Aurora, the Adeline Esker south of Freeport, and the Exeter Esker
west of Jacksonville.</p>
<p>The deposits of both the Illinoian and Wisconsinan glaciers
are widely distributed throughout the state. Melting of the
Illinoian glacier caused comparatively little flooding; consequently,
extensive gravel deposits were formed in only a few
places. The ice of the Wisconsinan glacier, however, melted
rapidly and produced great floods laden with sand and gravel.
Thus, most major gravel deposits in Illinois are related to the
Wisconsinan glacier.</p>
<p>Wind sweeping across the sand and gravel deposits blew
the sand into hills or sand dunes near such places as Havana,
Prophetstown, Kankakee, and Watseka. Even today the wind
shifts sand of long-forgotten glacial floods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h3 id="c17">Studies of Glacial Deposits</h3>
<p>The foregoing discussion of glaciers and their deposits is
greatly simplified. For some time geologists of the Illinois Geological
Survey have been mapping the moraines, valley trains, outwash
plains, and other glacial deposits of the state. Because the
Illinoian and Wisconsinan glaciers advanced and retreated several
times, they built many moraines. The Survey has made a map
(<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>) that shows the complexity of the moraines left by the
Wisconsinan glacier. They are roughly concentric, indicating that
the general shape of the glacier front remained about the same.</p>
<h3 id="c18">Principal Commercial Sources of Sand and Gravel</h3>
<p>The sand and gravel industry is widely distributed throughout
Illinois. The principal commercial sources of sand and gravel
are valley trains and outwash plains. The Fox, Rock, Illinois,
Mississippi, and Wabash Rivers and many smaller streams have
terraces in their valleys that are parts of valley trains. In these
deposits are some of the largest sand- and gravel-producing
operations in the state.</p>
<h3 id="c19">Composition</h3>
<p>An examination of glacial gravel deposits in Illinois reveals
pebbles and larger pieces of many kinds of rock. Some are
gray, others white, pink, brown, or black. They commonly include
limestone, dolomite, granite, and many rocks with less
common names such as quartzite, schist, and basalt. The limestone
and dolomite were picked up by the glaciers from outcrops in
northern Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Some of the granite
pebbles resemble outcrops in Wisconsin; others look like granite
that crops out in Canada. The quartzite probably came from Wisconsin,
and black shale fragments found in some gravel deposits
came from the floor of Lake Michigan or from western Michigan.
Occasionally pieces of metallic copper are found that probably
had their source in the Lake Superior copper-bearing area.</p>
<p>In addition to the sand associated with gravel deposits,
extensive deposits of sand alone are found at many places in Illinois.
Most of the sand grains are pieces of minerals that were
constituents of rocks until weathering, the grinding action of the
glaciers, and other erosive agencies broke the rocks into sand.
The principal mineral in glacial sand is quartz, but many others
occur in lesser amounts, including calcite, dolomite, feldspar,
pyroxene, tourmaline, garnet, magnetite, and hornblende. Most
of these are foreign to Illinois, although the calcite and dolomite
may be native.</p>

<h3 id="c20">Uses of Sand and Gravel</h3>
<p>In 1963 more than 27 million tons of sand and gravel,
directly or indirectly of glacial origin, was sold by Illinois producers
for almost 25 million dollars. The sand alone would have
filled a child&rsquo;s sand box, with an area of 8 square miles, to a depth
of 1 foot. The gravel would have covered an even larger area.</p>
<p>The gravel was used in making concrete for roads and
buildings, for surfacing roads, for ballast for railroad tracks, and
for other purposes. The sand found its way into plaster, mortar,
concrete, and a variety of other products and uses. Some of it was
produced for use as molding sand.</p>
<h3 id="c21">Production of Sand and Gravel</h3>
<p>The production of sand and gravel from its deposits may
be a relatively simple operation or one of considerable complexity.
Gravel for surfacing a road may be dug from a conveniently located
pit and loaded mechanically into trucks that haul it to the
road. A large sand- and gravel-producing operation, however,
may include not only mechanical equipment to load and transport
the material but also a processing plant where it can be washed
if necessary and screened to various sizes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>In a &ldquo;dry pit&rdquo; operation, mechanical cranes or shovels
pick up the gravel and sand and load it into trucks, railroad cars,
or conveyor belts to be transferred to the processing plant. There
clay and dirt may be washed out and the sand and gravel is sized
by screens. Conveyor belts carry sand and gravel to the various
processing operations and to storage bins or piles on the ground.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;wet pit&rdquo; operation produces sand and gravel from an
artificial pond or lake. In some operations the sand and gravel is
mined by a dredge that floats on the water (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). In some pits,
a stream of water is directed from the dredge against the bank of
gravel to wash the gravel into the lake. A large metal pipe at the
front of the dredge slants down into the water and sucks up the sand
and gravel from the underwater part of the deposit. The gravel,
sand, and water is then pumped through a pipe at the rear of the
dredge to the processing plant on the shore.</p>
<p>In some types of wet pit operations a large scoop or bucket
operated from a crane on the shore, or by cables fastened to the
shore, is used to dig sand and gravel from beneath the water.</p>
<p>Dredges are used to pump up sand and gravel from the beds
of Illinois rivers, especially the Mississippi, Ohio, and Wabash.</p>
<p>The sand and gravel resources of many parts of the state
have been mapped and studied by the Illinois Geological Survey,
and work of this kind is continuing.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">SILICA (TRIPOLI) AND OTHER MINERAL MATERIALS OF EXTREME SOUTHERN ILLINOIS</span></h2>
<p>The hills of extreme southern Illinois contain several
mineral materials that are entirely or largely restricted, in important
quantities, to that part of the state. Some of them, such as
silica and novaculite, come directly from bedrock deposits of
great age; others, such as some of the sands and gravels, are of
more recent origin.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Silica (Tripoli)</h3>
<p>A mineral material unique in Illinois is the amorphous
silica, or tripoli, mined in the hills of southern Illinois about
20 miles north of Cairo.</p>
<p>Most of the silica mines are found at the heads of valleys
or in tree-covered hill slopes along the less traveled roads. An
arched opening (<a href="#fig20">fig. 20</a>) with a road leading into it may be all that
is visible of the mine from the outside. Inside are many rooms,
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
some 30 feet high, separated by rounded pillars about 20 feet thick
that have been left to support the arched mine roof.</p>
<p>Most of the silica in the mines is white, and this is the
part that is mined. A silica deposit is made up of layers&mdash;some of
white, powdery rock material, others that look chalky but are firm
or hard.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1288" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 20&mdash;Entrance to a silica mine.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>In the mines the silica is blasted loose from the natural
deposit and loaded into trucks that take it to the processing mills
at Elco and Tamms, where it is crushed and then transferred to
huge grinding mills that pulverize it to a very fine powder. Air
currents of different velocities separate the powder into various
grades of fineness, and the finished silica goes into large paper
bags for shipment.</p>
<p><i>Origin of Silica.</i>&mdash;Some of the history of the formation of
silica deposits is not fully known, but it seems probable that their
original character was quite different from what it is today. Investigations
by Survey geologists suggest that the parent rock formation
was limestone and chert. The limestone was composed of
the mineral calcite, but scattered through it were myriads of small
particles of quartz. Interlayered with it were bands and beds of
chert that contained varying amounts of calcite.</p>
<p>As the rocks above them were worn away by the ceaseless
erosion of streams and rivers, these original deposits were uncovered.
Rain and snow-water then worked down into the limestone
and chert deposits through cracks and crevices and dissolved the
calcite in the rock. The quartz remained because it is much less
soluble than the calcite. After many thousands of years all the
calcite had been removed, leaving behind a &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; of quartz&mdash;the
silica deposits of today.</p>
<p><i>Uses of Silica.</i>-The silica mined and milled in southern
Illinois has many uses. A superfine grade, known as white rouge,
is used to polish optical lenses. Other grades are used in scouring
compounds, metal polishes, paints, electrical resistors, high-temperature
pipe coverings, fiberglass manufacture, plastics,
silicone rubber, wood filler, caulking compounds, ceramic products,
floor tile, billiard cue chalk, as foundry parting or facing,
concrete admixture, in the manufacture of buffing compounds that
are used to polish metal objects, and for other purposes. Industry
uses many thousands of tons of silica each year.</p>
<h3 id="c24">Chert and Chert Gravel</h3>
<p>Deposits of chert, chert gravel, and ganister also are
among the variety of mineral materials found in extreme southern
Illinois. Chert consists principally of minutely crystalline particles
of quartz. Some chert is popularly called flint. In southern
Illinois chert occurs in two principal kinds of deposits, those
composed of solid ledges and those consisting of gravel. The
term novaculite is used in southern Illinois for those solid deposits
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
that are white, comparatively thick, and free of other interlayered
materials. No novaculite is mined at present, but it is
said to have been sold in past years for making sodium silicate and
silica brick.</p>
<p>The chert gravels of southern Illinois are of three kinds&mdash;novaculite
gravel, Elco gravel, and &ldquo;Lafayette&rdquo; Gravel. The novaculite
and Elco gravels consist of fragments of chert plus lesser
amounts of fine silica particles and clay. The chert fragments of
the novaculite gravel are angular, but the Elco gravel includes
both angular and rounded fragments. These gravels are white,
yellow, brown, or reddish brown, the novaculite gravel usually
being the more highly colored. Deposits in Union and Alexander
Counties have been used for road surfacing and other purposes.
Deposits of chert gravel also occur in Hardin and Saline Counties,
and some stream valleys in southern and western Illinois also
contain such gravel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lafayette&rdquo; Gravel consists principally of brown chert
pebbles. Most of the pebbles are rounded and have a smooth,
semi-polished surface. The sand and clay occurring with the
gravel are brown or dark red. In some places there are deposits
of coarse, red quartz sand. The gravel is most abundant in the
four southernmost counties of the state, and deposits may be as
much as 65 feet thick. It is used principally as a road-surfacing
material.</p>
<h3 id="c25">Ganister</h3>
<p>Ganister occurs in the hills of Alexander and Union Counties
and is a loosely consolidated, granular material consisting
of irregular particles up to about an inch in diameter or of masses
of material readily disintegrated into such particles. The
particles are composed mainly of fine crystalline quartz. Ganister
is white, cream, light yellow, or red and occurs in deposits
up to 25 feet or more thick. Relatively small tonnages of the light
colored ganister are now used, principally in making refractories,
but ganister is said to have been more widely used in that field in
the past. It is produced from underground mines. Some red ganister,
or ganister like material, mined from open pits has been used
for road surfacing.</p>
<h3 id="c26">Studies of Southern Illinois Materials</h3>
<p>Survey geologists have mapped the chert- and silica-bearing
formations of Alexander and Union Counties and also many
of the various kinds of gravel deposits. Samples have been tested
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
to determine their chemical composition and the size of the particles
composing them. Laboratory studies by ceramists indicate
that novaculite and novaculite gravel, when suitably processed,
can be used for making silica brick, which withstands great heat.
Canister and the gravels of southern Illinois offer a variety of raw
materials awaiting increased industrial use.</p>
<h3 id="c27">Sands of Extreme Southern Illinois</h3>
<p>In southern Illinois deposits of sand laid down in an arm
of the ocean that once extended northward into Illinois from the
Gulf of Mexico are found in Alexander, Union, Pulaski, Pope, and
Massac Counties. The deposits are commonly a light color&mdash;white,
cream, yellow, or gray.</p>
<p>The grains of the sand are almost all quartz and generally
are angular. Some of the sands are of almost powder-like fineness,
others are fine or medium grained. Many of the sands
contain flakes of white mica, a glistening, silvery-looking mineral
often mistaken for silver or platinum. Unlike these metals,
however, mica is comparatively light in weight and is not metallic.
Also present in some sands are small flakes of the mineral graphite.</p>
<p>The southern Illinois sands have not been widely used,
but some of them have been employed in making concrete. They
also may have possibilities for molding and core sand.</p>
<p>As a result of work by Survey geologists, the location and
properties of many of the southern Illinois sand deposits are
known.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">CLAY AND SHALE</span></h2>
<p>Man has used clay in various ways for many hundreds of
years. From it he made, and still makes, bricks to build his
dwellings, pottery utensils of many kinds, and other useful
products.</p>
<p>Everyone knows what clay is, yet it is a substance difficult
to define. All clays are earth materials, most of them plastic
or sticky when wet but firm when dry. If heated sufficiently
(fired) they become hard.</p>
<p>Clays are composed of various minerals. Of these, the
so-called clay minerals&mdash;complex substances composed mostly
of alumina, silica, and water&mdash;generally are the most important.
They impart the property of plasticity and also cause clays to
become hard when fired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Most clays are what geologists call unindurated (unhardened)
rocks. Clay that has been indurated and occurs in layered
deposits is commonly called shale. The layers may be from a
fraction of an inch to several inches thick. Most Illinois shales
are not plastic when dug from freshly exposed deposits, but they
become plastic when crushed and kneaded with water. The clays
and shales of Illinois are the basis of a huge and important industry.</p>
<h3 id="c29">Early Uses in Illinois</h3>
<p>Clays and shales are useful because they can be made
plastic by adding water, formed into desired shapes, and fired to
a rock like hardness. As a result, various kinds of bricks, drain
tile, pottery, and other useful products are made from them. In its
early years, Illinois had many widely distributed potteries that
used clay from nearby deposits to make a variety of jugs, crocks,
and bowls that served in place of many present-day glass or metal
articles.</p>
<p>Drain tile has been of major importance in the development
of the state. Early settlers found many low lying, swampy areas
and tracts of land that drained poorly after heavy rains. Ditches
were dug to carry away the water from some areas, but others were
drained by means of drain tile&mdash;pieces of fired clay pipe several
inches in diameter and about a foot long that were laid end to end
in trenches below plough depth and then covered with earth. Water
seeped into the tile, which discharged it into ditches. Tile factories,
built throughout Illinois near clay or shale deposits, did
an active business. Gradually, however, as more and more farm
land was drained the demand slackened and many tile factories
went out of business. Although there are fewer factories, much
drain tile is still manufactured in Illinois.</p>
<p>Many of the early tile plants also made bricks to be used
for making foundations, buildings, sidewalks, and other structures.
The bricks were made by hand-operated equipment. Some
of the old hand-molded bricks may still be seen in older buildings.
Now the brick-making process is highly mechanized and even
though there are fewer plants they produce more bricks.</p>
<h3 id="c30">Clay and Shale Deposits</h3>
<p>Illinois shales are a part of the bedrock&mdash;that is, they
are associated with indurated rocks such as sandstone and limestone.
Most clays are surficial rocks occurring in deposits near
the surface, where they lie above the bedrock. Exceptions are
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
certain clays found in extreme southern Illinois and the underclays,
also called fireclays, that occur beneath coal seams and
are part of the bedrock.</p>
<p>The surficial clays are of two principal kinds&mdash;till and
loess. Till is a deposit left by glaciers. It is a gray, blue-gray,
or brown clay containing varying amounts of sand, pebbles,
cobbles, and even boulders. Till is found at many places in the
state and is used for brick making, especially in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>Loess is a wind-deposited silty clay or clayey silt and
is found in many parts of Illinois. It is thickest on or near the
bluffs of the Mississippi, Illinois, and Ohio Rivers. It generally
is brown and stands in steep faces in roadcuts and other excavations.
It once was widely used for making brick and tile.</p>
<p>Of major importance in making clay products in Illinois
are the bedrock shales and the clays associated with the coal-bearing
rocks that underlie much of the state. The shales, and the
clays to a lesser extent, are dug at many places for making
structural clay products such as bricks, structural tile, and drain
tile. They also are used to make lightweight aggregate for concrete.
The underclays of some of the older coal seams are used
to make buff-colored brick, stoneware, and a highly heat-resistant
brick (firebrick) that is used in industrial furnaces or in other operations
involving high temperatures. Some fireclay, ground as fine
as flour, is added to molding sand to make it coherent enough to
form into molds for metal casting. Sewer pipe and flue lining also
are made from underclays.</p>
<p>Clays unlike those found elsewhere in the state occur in
extreme southern Illinois. One of these has the property of removing
color from oils and was so used at one time by petroleum
refineries. Another, kaolin, was extensively used during World
War I for making crucibles.</p>
<h3 id="c31">Clay Minerals</h3>
<p>The uses of clay and shale are determined to a large degree
by the properties of their clay minerals and to a lesser degree by
the impurities present. A clay or shale containing the clay mineral
illite, and other similar but less important clay minerals, commonly
becomes red when fired and gets hard at a relatively low temperature.
It therefore is used to make red bricks, drain tile, building
tile, and other structural clay products.</p>
<p>Another clay mineral, kaolinite, generally burns to a
light color and is difficult to fuse. Therefore, clays composed
wholly or mainly of kaolinite can be used for making buff or light-colored
bricks and for the manufacture of highly heat-resistant
(refractory) bricks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The clay mineral in the southern Illinois clay that was used
to decolorize oil is montmorillonite. This clay is now used in
sweeping compounds, as an oil absorbent, as animal litter, and
for other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="c32">Studies of Clay and Shale</h3>
<p>In view of the significant relationship between the clay
minerals and the utilization of the clays and shales in which they
occur, the Illinois Geological Survey has investigated extensively
the clay minerals in the clay and shale deposits of Illinois. Many
samples were studied by means of powerful microscopes, X-ray,
and chemical analysis. Most of the surface clays and shales
proved to be composed principally of illite or related minerals.
The kaolin clay of extreme southern Illinois contains the mineral
kaolinite. The older underclays also contain kaolinite, but many
of them also contain smaller amounts of illite.</p>
<p>The Survey also has tested many clays to determine their
burning properties and color when fired, and hence their potential
uses. The bonding capabilities of other clays have been measured
to find out whether they can be used as a bonding material for
molding sand. The bloating properties of Illinois clays and shales
from many deposits have been studied to determine which are
suitable for making lightweight aggregate for the manufacture of
concrete.</p>
<p>The object of these studies has been to discover the location,
character, and possible uses of the state&rsquo;s clay and shale
resources. Special studies are continuing in several parts of the
state. Illinois is well endowed with clays and shales that can be
used for a variety of purposes and has resources to fill future as
well as present needs.</p>
<h3 id="c33">How Bricks Are Made</h3>
<p>Conversion of Illinois clays and shales into useful products
is an interesting process and is exemplified by the making of building
bricks. Mechanical shovels dig the clay or shale and load it
into trucks or small railroad cars that take it to the brick plant.
There, machines grind the raw material and mix water with it until
it has the consistency of stiff mud.</p>
<p>Next, a machine, which operates somewhat like a meat
grinder, extrudes a brick-sized column of clay. As the column
moves forward, it is automatically cut into bricks by wires. The
bricks are then dried in large heated rooms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<div class="img" id="fig21">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="705" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 21&mdash;Beehive brick kiln.</p>
</div>
<p>From the driers, the bricks go to huge ovens (kilns) and
are heated until they are hard and have attained the desired color.
This is known as firing or burning the bricks. Temperatures employed
are rarely lower than 1800&deg; F.</p>
<p>Three kinds of kilns are used in Illinois for burning bricks&mdash;beehive,
tunnel, and scove. A beehive kiln (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>) has a round
base and a dome-shaped top and somewhat resembles an oversized
beehive. Unfired bricks are stacked in the kiln and the doors are
sealed with burned bricks and clay. Fires are started in hearths
or fire boxes in the wall of the kiln and the heat is circulated into
and through the kiln. It usually takes several days to fire the bricks
adequately and let the kiln cool so that the bricks can be removed.</p>
<p>Tunnel kilns, made from heat-resistant bricks, are actually
tunnels big enough for a man to stand in. The unburned bricks are
loaded on flat steel cars on top of a layer of refractory blocks that
protect the steel from the heat. The cars enter the kiln and heating
begins. As they move through the kiln, they carry the bricks
through a firing area, then through a cooling zone, and finally out
into the air.</p>
<p>In some brickyards in the Chicago area, dried unburned
bricks are carefully stacked by machines into piles about 17 feet
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
high, 35 feet wide, and 115 feet long, which are known as scoves
or scove kilns. A layer of burned bricks that is plastered with clay
covers the sides of the scove. A jet of flame is directed through
small tunnels at the base of the scove, and the heat fires the bricks.</p>
<p>During 1963, more than 325,000,000 bricks were produced
by Illinois brick plants. In the same year, the value of all the
clay and clay products produced in Illinois was nearly $54,000,000.
Besides brick and drain tile, the products of the clay and shale industry
of Illinois include refractory brick, building block and tile,
fire-proofing, sewer pipe, flue liners, stoneware, lightweight
bloated burned clay aggregate for concrete, and a variety of unburned
clays for special purposes, including bonding clay, refractory
fireclays, absorbent for use on garage floors, and litter
for animal cages.</p>
<h2 id="c34"><span class="small">PEAT</span></h2>
<p>After the retreat of the last of the great ice sheets from
Illinois, numerous ponds and lakes were left in northern Illinois,
especially in the eastern section. Some of them were soon drained
by natural processes, but others remained. In the shallow water
along their shores grew various plants, chiefly reeds and sedges
and, locally, a variety of moss. As the plants died, their partially
decomposed remains were preserved beneath the water. Ultimately,
the ponds and lakes were overgrown and more or less completely
filled by the plants and their remains, giving rise to peat (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>)
bogs.</p>
<p>Some peat bogs have been drained and are now used as
farm land. Others remain and a few of them are the source of peat
or humus for horticultural purposes. Producing operations are located
in northeastern Illinois and in Whiteside County in northwestern
Illinois.</p>
<h2 id="c35"><span class="small">OTHER MINERAL RESOURCES</span></h2>
<p>In the future, new uses will be made of the Illinois industrial
minerals already discussed. In addition, other mineral resources
of the state that are not now being used may be the bases
of new mineral industries. Some of these minerals are at present
too costly to mine because the deposits are deeply buried or are
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
not sufficiently rich to be worked at a profit. Others are not convenient
to markets, and still others have no present commercial
use. In years to come, however, changes may occur that will make
it practical to mine, process, and use some of these resources.
Furthermore, some other mineral deposits that are now being utilized
in a limited way may have greater future use. The Illinois
Geological Survey continues to study the location, character, and
composition of many such mineral materials and is alert for the
development of new uses. Some of the materials are discussed
briefly below.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">

<h3 id="c36">Gypsum and Anhydrite</h3>
<p>Gypsum is a mineral that consists of calcium sulfate plus
two molecules of water (CaSO&#8324;&middot;2H&#8322;O). By suitably heating it, the
amount of water can be reduced, and a product called calcined
gypsum (plaster of paris) results. This material changes back to
gypsum if mixed with an appropriate quantity of water. The ability
of calcined gypsum to &ldquo;set&rdquo; when water is added makes it
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
important in the manufacture of a variety of plasters and related
products, especially building materials. Gypsum also is used in
cement making and in agriculture.</p>
<p>Anhydrite (CaSO&#8324;) is like gypsum except that it contains
no water and hence cannot be made into plaster of paris. Its uses
are limited in the United States.</p>
<p>Wells that were drilled for oil, water, or coal have encountered
gypsum and/or anhydrite in some parts of south-central
Illinois, but the gypsum and anhydrite are not known to crop out
at the surface. A study of diamond drill cores and well cuttings
on file at the Survey showed that the shallowest gypsum and anhydrite
reported occurred at a depth of 470 feet in Madison County.
The greatest continuous thickness of gypsum found was 2 feet;
but in one well, over 6 feet of strata was penetrated that averaged
almost 75 percent gypsum. It is possible that thicker deposits of
gypsum might be found if drilling were done especially in search
of it.</p>
<h3 id="c37">Feldspar-Bearing Sands</h3>
<p>Feldspar is the name applied to a group of minerals that
are mainly silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium. Various
kinds of feldspar are used industrially in making glass, enamels,
pottery, and other products. All the feldspar now used in Illinois
is shipped into the state. The discovery by the Illinois Survey
that some Illinois sands contain considerable feldspar led Survey
geologists and chemists to find where deposits highest in feldspar
occur, what kinds of feldspar they contain, and whether it could
be separated from the sand in which it occurs. Beach sands, river
sands, dune sands, and sands from other kinds of deposits were
studied.</p>
<p>It was found that many sands contain more than 15 percent
feldspar and some as much as 25 percent. Means of separating
the feldspar from the sand are believed to exist, but problems relating
to the purity of the separated spar remain to be solved.</p>
<h3 id="c38">Brines</h3>
<p>No salt is now produced in Illinois, but at one time the
state was a major salt producer. Salt works were in operation
near Equality, Central City, Murphysboro, St. John, Danville,
and possibly other places. The salt was obtained by evaporating
salt water (brine) that came from natural springs or from wells.
The Equality area was a particularly important producer of salt in
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
the 1800&rsquo;s. Discovery elsewhere in the Middle West of deposits
of rock salt and brines that contained more salt than those of Illinois
is said to have been responsible for the discontinuance of
salt making in the state.</p>
<p>No salt beds crop out in Illinois, nor are any known to
have been encountered in the many wells that have been drilled for
coal, oil, or water. However, most oil well drilling encounters
brines containing various amounts and kinds of salts, including
the common table salt, sodium chloride.</p>
<p>For reasons relating to the production of oil, Survey geologists
and chemists have collected and analyzed many samples of
Illinois oil field brines, and data are therefore available on their
salt content. No commercial use is being made of the brines as
sources of salt.</p>
<h3 id="c39">Oil Shale</h3>
<p>Illinois has a large oil-producing industry that obtains oil
from wells. The state also contains beds of shale that yield oil
when the shale is heated.</p>
<p>In order to estimate the present and future importance of
the oil shale resources, the Survey collected and tested more than
100 shale samples from 41 Illinois counties. A few samples contained
more than 25 gallons of oil per ton of shale, but most contained
less than 15 gallons per ton. A study of the crude oil distilled
from selected shale samples showed it to be somewhat different
from the oil that comes from wells. It could, nevertheless,
be made to yield gasoline, fuel oil, and other products if suitably
processed.</p>
<p>The shale strata generally the richest in oil are found above
coal seams, are black, and are sometimes called slate by coal
miners. They are rarely more than 3 feet thick, but they extend
over large areas.</p>
<h3 id="c40">Sandstone</h3>
<p>Sandstone has a long history of use in Illinois. Pioneers
built foundations for their houses and barns and curbs around their
wells from it. Slabs of sandstone were once a popular material
for sidewalks, some of which are still in use. Churches and other
sizable buildings have been constructed from it, and at one time
an Illinois sandstone was used to make grindstones. Except for
the St. Peter Sandstone, which was discussed under &ldquo;Silica Sand,&rdquo;
the use of sandstone has decreased, although comparatively small
quantities are still used as building stone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Most Illinois sandstones may be thought of as a mass of
sand whose grains are more or less firmly cemented together by
clay, iron oxide, and quartz, either singly or in combination, or,
less commonly, by calcite. The grains are particles of various
minerals, but most of them are quartz.</p>
<p>Sandstones are especially common in the hill country of
extreme southern Illinois. The Survey&rsquo;s investigations in this area
revealed that if they are suitably processed some of the sandstones
may have possibilities for commercial use. Sandstones in other
parts of the state also have been studied, with similar conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="c41">Barite</h3>
<p>Barite (barium sulfate, BaSO&#8324;) is a deceptive mineral&mdash;it is
much heavier than it looks. Barite found in Illinois is generally
white or light colored, and, although some of it looks rather like
white limestone, it is more than half again as heavy as limestone.
Barite&rsquo;s unusual weight is responsible for one of its major uses&mdash;as
a constituent of drilling muds for the oil industry. These muds
are a mixture of clay, water, and a weighting material such as
barite. They are used in various ways in the drilling of oil wells
by rotary drills. Barite also is an important raw material for the
manufacture of chemicals.</p>
<p>Barite is found in Hardin and Pope Counties, the site of
the fluorspar industry. According to studies made by Survey geologists,
the barite occurs both as veins and beds associated with
fluorspar, but its distribution is irregular and the deposits are of
limited size. A barite mine is said to have been worked years ago,
and more recently comparatively small tonnages have been taken
from open pits. Future exploration in southern Illinois may reveal
deposits of barite that will be profitable to mine.</p>
<h3 id="c42">Greensand</h3>
<p>In some parts of Illinois occur sands or sandstone that
contain numerous grains of the green mineral glauconite. If the
sands are not discolored by iron compounds or other substances,
they too have a greenish color and, therefore, are called greensands.
Glauconite varies in composition but contains potassium,
magnesium, iron, aluminum, silicon, and water. Greensand is
said to be used in relatively small amounts as a soil conditioner
and as a water-softening agent.</p>
<p>Greensand is known to occur in the general vicinity of
Olmsted in southern Illinois. Near Oregon in northern Illinois an
old quarry exposed 10 feet of greenish brown sandstone that contains
glauconite. Samples from southern Illinois and from the sandstone
at Oregon contained more than 6 percent potassium oxide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h3 id="c43">Marl</h3>
<p>In some of the lakes and ponds left by the glaciers lived
numerous small mollusks with calcium carbonate shells. As the
animals died, their shells formed a deposit on the bottom of the
lakes and ponds. Certain plants, especially algae, may have
added a mudlike precipitate of calcium carbonate to the deposits,
and varying amounts of clay washed from the shores mixed with
both these materials. The resultant deposit is called marl. Some
marl deposits have peat mixed with them, and peat also overlies
some marl deposits.</p>
<p>Only comparatively small amounts of marl are known to
have been dug in Illinois. One deposit containing many shells and
shell fragments, some of it associated with peat, was worked in
southeastern Livingston County as a source of agricultural liming
material. Other deposits have been reported at other places in
northeastern Illinois. The available information indicates that the
marl deposits are likely to be principally of local importance.</p>
<h3 id="c44">Tufa and Travertine</h3>
<p>The tufa (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>) and travertine occurring as surficial deposits
in Illinois were formed by springs. The deposits usually
occur at or near the outcrop of a layer of porous water-bearing
earth material, such as gravel, sandstone, or fissured limestone,
that is underlain by a nonporous clay or shale formation. Water
moving down through the porous layer cannot sink through the clay
or shale and so is forced to move laterally. Where valleys have
cut into the layers of gravel or rock, the water emerges as springs.</p>
<p>If the material through which the water has passed is limestone,
or gravel containing limestone as most Illinois gravels do,
some of the limestone is likely to have dissolved in the water.
When the water issues as a spring, conditions may be such as to
cause precipitation of the dissolved limestone as tufa or, more
rarely, travertine.</p>
<p>Tufa is generally highly porous and more or less impure,
whereas travertine is harder and less porous.</p>
<p>The middle or lower slopes of bluffs are common sites for
spring-deposited tufa or travertine. Deposits have been seen in
various parts of Illinois, but are not known to have been worked,
except in Calhoun County where small quantities of tufa were produced
for use as agricultural limestone. It is thought that the tufa
and travertine deposits of Illinois are relatively small, but they
may be of local importance.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c45">Pyrite and Marcasite</h3>
<p>The mineral pyrite consists of iron and sulfur as the compound
iron sulfide (FeS&#8322;) and, because of its shiny, brassy yellow
color, is sometimes called fool&rsquo;s gold. Marcasite has the same
composition as pyrite, but its crystals have a different shape and
it is often lighter colored. Both minerals occur in various parts
of the state; they are particularly prevalent in some coal seams,
and when so occurring are in some cases called coal brasses or
&ldquo;sulfur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pyrite and marcasite are used commercially as raw materials
for making sulfuric acid, although sulfur itself is more extensively
used for that purpose. At one time coal brasses recovered during
coal-cleaning operations at a northwestern Illinois coal mine were
sold for acid making. A large quantity of coal brasses probably
could be recovered from such operations at Illinois coal mines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h3 id="c46">Uranium</h3>
<p>Uranium has been sought in Illinois by many people in
recent years. The Geological Survey also carried out a wide search
for uranium and particular attention was paid to certain clays and
other rocks in Hardin County and certain black shales in other parts
of the state.</p>
<p>About 200 samples from Hardin County and 175 samples
of the shales were tested by the Survey. No deposits were found
that are known to be of the required richness and quantity.</p>
<h3 id="c47">Iron Ore</h3>
<p>About the middle of the 19th century two furnaces in Hardin
County in extreme southern Illinois for a time produced iron from
local limonite ores. The ore is said to have occurred as pellets,
chunks, and masses scattered through soil and clay and apparently
was of irregular distribution. Little can be seen of the deposits
today. Their extent is not known, but they are believed to be of
limited size.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>The Illinois State Geological Survey carries on a
continuous program of research on the industrial minerals
and metals of Illinois and their uses.</p>
<p>In addition to the investigations mentioned in this
booklet, many others have been made or are in progress.
Such studies are necessarily a continuing activity if the
full potentialities of Illinois mineral resources are to be
realized, for industry continually demands new raw materials
and changes its requirements for those now used.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
